No further changes to these terms and conditions may be made unless both TToffer group and you sign a written amendment.
    </p>
  <p class="content">9.1 Qualifications. You might need to fulfill the qualifying requirements set out by each AH that holds a live auction in order to take part in it. To take part in a particular Live Auction, you might need to register and get approved. Acceptance to take part in a live auction does not imply acceptance to take part in any subsequent live auction, held by that AH or by another AH. The exclusive right of each AH to reject your eligibility for a Live Auction remains unaltered.</p>
  <p class="content">9.2Charges. A winning bidder must pay a buyer's premium, which is an additional fee over the auction price, together with shipping, handling, and other costs, at each AH. These fees are determined by the AH and are liable to vary based on the specific item for sale and the AH.</p>
  <p class="content">9.3 TToffer is Just a Place.</p>
  <p class="content">9.3.1 Services. We are not holding the live auctions and are not an auction house or an auctioneer. You can take part in live auctions held by the AHs with our service. We serve only as an intermediary to help you communicate with the AH. An agency connection is not established, nor do we seek to form one. We reserve the right to modify or terminate any or all of our services at any time, at our sole discretion.</p>
  <p class="content">9.3.2 Expertise. The things offered, their quality, authenticity, safety, or legality, the veracity or accuracy of the AHs' content or listings, the AHs' capacity to sell, or the ability of purchasers to purchase items are all outside our control. We don't guarantee that a vendor or buyer will carry out a transaction.</p>
  <p class="content">9.3.3 Release. You release TToffer (and our officers, directors, agents, parent, subsidiaries, joint ventures, and employees) from any and all claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of any kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes in the event that you have a dispute with an AH. You specifically waive any protections (statutory or otherwise) that would otherwise restrict the coverage of this release to only those claims that you may have known or believed to be in your favor at the time you agreed to this release by entering into it.</p>
  <p class="content">9.4 Auction Homes. AHs may occasionally post items up for auction so that authorized and registered players can place bids. The amount, nature, order, and schedule of the items up for auction, together with the dates and times of the auction, are all determined by the AH and are subject to change at any time. Specific lots and goods are subject to change at any time. The online Live Auction services will not contain certain lots and items that the AHs make available on the auction floor, on their own websites, or on websites of third parties. The data that AHs submit and make accessible via our system is not within our control. We do not warrant that the AHs uphold valid auctioneer's licenses or adhere to all relevant legal requirements.</p>
  <p class="content">9.5 Remote Bidding. You agree that we will use our software tools to submit bids on your behalf using the bid increment amount, which is based on the current high bid, if you decide to participate in a live auction with absentee bidding as opposed to real-time interactive bidding. To ensure that you stay the highest bidder, we will only place bids as much as are required, up to the amount of your maximum bid. Your absentee bid operates on the same terms as any other maximum bid on the TToffer website, with the exception that it is blind, meaning you won't be aware of your bid amount or if another absentee bidder outbids you), a buyer's premium will be added to your bid, and all bids must be placed on the increment. When the Live Auction begins, absentee bidding ceases.</p>
  <p class="content">9.6 Purchase, Bidding, and Sale Terms. The AH shall post the terms and conditions (the "AH Terms and Conditions") for each auction, as well as the terms of sale unique to each Live Auction event. Your participation in a Live Auction and your bidding activity are governed by these Terms and Conditions as well as any applicable AH Terms and Conditions. In its capacity as an auctioneer, the AH makes all final decisions about the item's bidding and sale.</p>
  <p class="content">9.7 Audio and Video. A live auction's audiovisual components are solely meant for amusement. You should not rely on either for purposes of participating in an auction.</p>
